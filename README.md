# RunAfterError
This is a script in greyhack that allows code to run first and then spit out a error


<br>These are what happens when those scripts run after executing</br>

<br>I also made these on a whim a long time ago when i was experimenting with GreyScript and discovered this and yes i think it is a cursed way to avoid a error and allow the program to execute first and then spit out the error</br>
